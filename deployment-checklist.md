# Netlify Deployment Checklist - Missing Functions Fix

## Current Issue
Your Netlify site has NO FUNCTIONS deployed, which is why:
- Chatbot shows "Failed to send message" 
- No Functions tab appears in Netlify dashboard
- API endpoints return "Page not found"

## Required Files for Functions to Work
You need these specific files in your Netlify deployment:

### Essential Function Files:
```
netlify/
├── functions/
│   ├── chat.js          (AI chatbot endpoint)
│   ├── contact.js       (contact form endpoint) 
│   └── test-env.js      (environment test endpoint)
└── netlify.toml         (configuration file)
```

### Required Configuration:
```
dist/                    (your React app)
_redirects              (routing rules)
package.json            (dependencies)
shared/                 (database schemas)
```

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Download from Replit:**
   - Right-click `netlify` folder → Download
   - Right-click `dist` folder → Download  
   - Download `netlify.toml` file
   - Download `_redirects` file
   - Download `package.json`
   - Download `shared` folder

2. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Go to your site → Deploys tab
   - Drag all downloaded files/folders into the deploy area
   - Wait for build to complete

3. **Verify Functions Deployed:**
   - Functions tab should appear in dashboard
   - Test: https://www.ilove-ai.co.za/.netlify/functions/test-env
   - Should return JSON with environment status

## After Deployment Success:
- Functions tab will appear in Netlify dashboard
- Chatbot will work with your OpenAI API key
- Contact forms will save to database
