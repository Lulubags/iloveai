NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================

FILES IN THIS PACKAGE:
- netlify/ folder (serverless functions for chatbot and contact form)
- dist/ folder (your built React application)
- netlify.toml (Netlify configuration)
- _redirects (URL routing rules)
- package.json (Node.js dependencies)
- shared/ folder (database schemas)

HOW TO DEPLOY:
1. Extract all files from this archive
2. Go to Netlify dashboard → Your site → Deploys tab
3. Drag ALL files and folders into the deploy area
4. Wait for deployment to complete (2-5 minutes)

AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
- Functions tab will appear in your Netlify dashboard
- Test environment: https://www.ilove-ai.co.za/.netlify/functions/test-env
- Should show: {"hasOpenAIKey": true, "hasDatabaseURL": false}
- Chatbot will work with your OpenAI API key

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If Functions tab doesn't appear, the netlify/ folder wasn't uploaded correctly
- If chatbot still fails, check function logs in Netlify dashboard
- Environment variables are already configured correctly

Your OpenAI API key setup in Netlify is perfect - this deployment will fix the missing functions issue.
