# Quick Deploy Package for Netlify

## What's Missing
Your current Netlify deployment has NO serverless functions, which is why:
- The chatbot doesn't work
- No "Functions" tab in your dashboard

## Files in This Package
- `netlify/` - Contains the serverless functions (chat.js, contact.js, test-env.js)
- `dist/` - Your built React application 
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- `_redirects` - URL routing rules
- `package.json` - Dependencies for functions
- `shared/` - Database schemas

## Deploy Instructions
1. Download all these files/folders from your Replit
2. Go to Netlify → Your site → Deploys
3. Drag and drop ALL files into the deploy area
4. Wait for build to complete
5. Check that "Functions" tab appears in dashboard
6. Test chatbot at https://www.ilove-ai.co.za

## Verify Success
- Functions tab appears in Netlify dashboard
